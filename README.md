You can find some cool custom react hooks in this repository for you use

1. `useDebounce`: This hook debounces a given function so that it is only called after a certain amount of time has passed without the function being called again.

2. `useKeyPress`: This hook returns a boolean indicating whether a given key is currently being pressed.

3. `useInterval`: This hook sets up a repeating interval and returns a function that can be used to cancel the interval.

4. `useToggle`: This hook returns a boolean value and a function to toggle the boolean value.

5. `useWindowSize`: This hook returns the current width and height of the window.

6. `useLocalStorage`: This hook allows you to easily get and set values in local storage.
